# Overview of the school district analysis

This was an analysis on different district schools focusing on their math and reading grades. After reviewing the data, Thomas High School's 9th grade class was caught with academic dishonesty. I was asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School and repeat the school district analysis to write a report on how these changes affected the analysis.
